# Course Info App â€“ Full Stack Open (Part 1, Exercises 1.1â€“1.5)

This React app was created as part of the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course offered by the University of Helsinki.

## ðŸ“š Description

The app displays a course name, a list of its parts, and the number of exercises in each part. It also calculates and displays the total number of exercises.

Each step in the exercises (from 1.1 to 1.5) introduces incremental improvements to the structure and logic of the application, culminating in a clean, reusable, and maintainable component-based architecture.

## âœ… Features

- Course data stored in a single JavaScript object
- Three functional components:
  - `Header`: displays the course name
  - `Content`: renders each part of the course with its exercise count
  - `Total`: calculates and displays the total number of exercises
- Uses `.map()` to render parts
- Uses `.reduce()` to calculate the total
